# Udacity FEND Restaurant Review App

This is my Udacity Nano-degree project to re-create a restaurant review app that is responsive, accessible, and works offline.

## Getting Started

Step 1.  Git clone the repository
Step 2.  If you don't have python installed, [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
Step 3.  Verify your python installation by running the command "python -V" from your command line.  You should get a response with your version of Python, if not, doublecheck step 2.
Step 4.  Navigate to the root directory of where you cloned the repository.
Step 5.  Run the python command "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000" to start HTTP Server.
Step 6.  Launch web browser and nagivate to "http://localhost:8000"
Step 7.  Enjoy!

## Using the Restaurant Review App

You will start on the home page which has a map of restaurants in New York City.  You can Filter your results with the "Filter Results" drop down.  You can filter by Neighborhood or by Cuisines.

A list of the restaurants will appear at the bottom of the page.  You can click on the "View Details" button to see more details for any of the restaurants.

Once in a restaurant's details page you will see the restaurant hours, address, a map of where the restaurant is located, as well as reviews for that restaurant.

At any time, once you are in the restaurant details page you can follow the breadcumbs at the top of the page you can navigate back to the home page.
